# Tenzies Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tenzies game using React. In Tenzies, the goal is to roll dice until all of them show the same number. You can hold dice to keep their values while rolling the others.<br>
I made this project while following the Learn React course on [scrimba.com](scrimba.com)
